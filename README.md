# UFOs-analysis

## Overview of Project
An html pages is created to display an article and table that can be filtered to sift through data. The table holds information of ufo sightings.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to display these ufo sightings in the table. Using javaScript the table will be manipulated by adding five filters that can be used to refine the data presented in the table. The categories that can be used to search through the table are date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
The ufo sighting data table initially will display all off the logged sightings. What is presented in the table can be narrowed down using the five filters. These filters can also be used to pinpoint a specific sighting. The dynamic table will change depending upon the search criteria for the date, location, or shape.

For example, in the image above, the table only displays ufo sightings that occurred in the US on 1/9/2010 due to the input search criteria using the filters on the left hand side of the page. 

## Summary
### Drawbacks
One drawback of this webpage is that the data is not very up to date, the most recent data entry is from 1/13/2010.
### Further Development
For further development of this page, I would recommend adding a spot for ufo sighting submissions. Doing so would allow people to submit there sightings which could be added to the table to keep the page more up to date.
Another filter could also be added for sighting duration so that the search can be further refined if desired.
